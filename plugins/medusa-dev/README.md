# Medusa Claude Code Plugin

A comprehensive set of skills for Claude Code to help developers build Medusa applications with best practices and architectural patterns.

Use this plugin to build backend and frontend features related to Medusa.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed
- A Medusa project (or planning to create one)

### Install Plugin

1. Start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

2. Add Medusa marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
```

3. Install the plugin:

/plugin install medusa-dev@medusa
```

4. Verify the plugin is loaded:

/plugin
```

You should see the Medusa plugin listed under the Installed tab.

## Use Plugin

In your Medusa application, ask Claude to build features. Claude will know what to load from the Medusa plugin to build your feature.

### Example Use Cases

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to build:

**Example 1: Full-stack Feature with Admin UI**

> Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard

**Example 2: Backend API Development**

> Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.

**Example 3: Admin Dashboard Widget**

> Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.

**Example 5: Storefront Integration**

> Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.
