# Ecommerce Storefront Best Practices

Comprehensive guidance for building modern, high-converting ecommerce storefronts covering UI/UX patterns, component design, layout structures, SEO optimization, and mobile responsiveness.

## When to Apply

**ALWAYS load this skill when working on ANY storefront task:**

- **Adding checkout page/flow** - Payment, shipping, order placement
- **Implementing cart** - Cart page, cart popup, add to cart functionality
- **Building product pages** - Product details, product listings, product grids
- **Creating navigation** - Navbar, megamenu, footer, mobile menu
- **Integrating Medusa backend** - SDK setup, cart, products, payment
- **Any storefront component** - Homepage, search, filters, account pages
- Building new ecommerce storefronts from scratch
- Improving existing shopping experiences and conversion rates
- Optimizing for usability, accessibility, and SEO
- Designing mobile-responsive ecommerce experiences

**Example prompts that should trigger this skill:**
- "Add a checkout page"
- "Implement shopping cart"
- "Create product listing page"
- "Connect to Medusa backend"
- "Add navigation menu"
- "Build homepage for store"

## CRITICAL: Load Reference Files When Needed

**⚠️ ALWAYS load `reference/design.md` BEFORE creating ANY UI component**
- Discovers existing design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, patterns)
- Prevents introducing inconsistent styles
- Provides guardrails for maintaining brand consistency
- **Required for every component, not just new storefronts**

**Load these references based on what you're implementing:**

- **Starting a new storefront?** → MUST load `reference/design.md` first to discover user preferences
- **Connecting to backend API?** → MUST load `reference/connecting-to-backend.md` first
- **Connecting to Medusa backend?** → MUST load `reference/medusa.md` for SDK setup, pricing, regions, and Medusa patterns
- **Implementing homepage?** → MUST load `reference/components/navbar.md`, `reference/components/hero.md`, `reference/components/footer.md`, and `reference/layouts/home-page.md`
- **Implementing navigation?** → MUST load `reference/components/navbar.md` and optionally `reference/components/megamenu.md`
- **Building product listing?** → MUST load `reference/layouts/product-listing.md` first
- **Building product details?** → MUST load `reference/layouts/product-details.md` first
- **Implementing checkout?** → MUST load `reference/layouts/checkout.md` first
- **Optimizing for SEO?** → MUST load `reference/seo.md` first
- **Optimizing for mobile?** → MUST load `reference/mobile-responsiveness.md` first

**Minimum requirement:** Load at least 1-2 reference files relevant to your specific task before implementing.

## Planning and Implementation Workflow

**IMPORTANT: If you create a plan for implementing storefront features, include the following in your plan:**

When implementing each component, page, layout, or feature in the plan:
1. **Refer back to this skill** before starting implementation
2. **Load relevant reference files** listed above for the specific component/page you're building
3. **Follow the patterns and guidance** in the reference files
4. **Check common mistakes** sections to avoid known pitfalls

**Example plan structure:**

```
Task 1: Implement Navigation
- Load reference/components/navbar.md
- Follow patterns from navbar.md (dynamic category fetching, cart visibility, etc.)
- Refer to skill for common mistakes (e.g., hardcoding categories)

Task 2: Implement Product Listing Page
- Load reference/layouts/product-listing.md
- Follow pagination/filtering patterns from product-listing.md
- Use reference/components/product-card.md for product grid items
- Check skill for backend integration guidance

Task 3: Implement Checkout Flow
- Load reference/layouts/checkout.md
- Load reference/medusa.md for Medusa payment integration
- Follow component architecture recommendations (separate step components)
- Refer to skill for payment method fetching requirements
```

**Why this matters:**
- Plans provide high-level strategy
- Reference files provide detailed implementation patterns
- Skill file contains critical mistakes to avoid
- Following this workflow ensures consistency and best practices

## Critical Ecommerce-Specific Patterns

### Accessibility
- **CRITICAL: Cart count updates require `aria-live="polite"`** - Screen readers won't announce without it
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all cart/checkout interactions

### Mobile
- **Sticky bottom elements MUST use `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`** - iOS home indicator will cut off purchase buttons otherwise
- 44px minimum touch targets for cart actions, variant selectors, quantity buttons

### Performance
- **ALWAYS add `loading="lazy"` to product images below fold** - Don't rely on browser defaults
- Optimize product images for mobile (<500KB) - Most ecommerce traffic is mobile

### Conversion Optimization
- Clear CTAs throughout shopping flow
- Minimal friction in checkout (guest checkout if supported)
- Trust signals (reviews, security badges, return policy) near purchase buttons
- Clear pricing and shipping information upfront

### SEO
- **Product schema (JSON-LD) required** - Critical for Google Shopping and rich snippets
- Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to measure Core Web Vitals

### Visual Design
- **NEVER use emojis** in storefront UI - Use icons or images instead (unprofessional, accessibility issues)

### Backend Integration
- **Backend detection**: If in monorepo, check for backend directory. If unsure, ask user which backend is used.
- **NEVER hardcode dynamic content**: Always fetch categories, regions, products, shipping options, etc. from backend - they change frequently
- Never assume API structure - verify endpoints and data formats

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backend SDK Method Verification Workflow

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT WORKFLOW BEFORE WRITING CODE THAT CONNECTS TO BACKEND:**

**Step 1: PAUSE - Do NOT write code yet**
- You are about to write code that calls a backend API or SDK method (e.g., Medusa SDK, REST API, GraphQL)
- **STOP** - Do not proceed to code without verification

**Step 2: QUERY the documentation or MCP server**
- **If MCP server available**: Query it for the exact method (for example, medusa MCP)
- **If no MCP server**: Search official documentation
- **Find**: Exact method name, parameters, return type

**Step 3: VERIFY what you found**
- State out loud to the user: "I need to verify the correct method for [operation]. Let me check [MCP server/documentation]."
- Show the user what you found: "According to [source], the method is `sdk.store.cart.methodName(params)`"
- Confirm the method signature and parameters

**Step 4: ONLY THEN write the code**
- Now you can write code using the verified method
- Use the exact signature you found

**Step 5: CHECK for TypeScript errors**
- After writing the code, check for any TypeScript/type errors related to the SDK
- If you see type errors on SDK methods, it means you used an incorrect method name or wrong parameters
- **Type errors are a sign you didn't verify correctly** - Go back to Step 2

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL - THIS IS MANDATORY ERROR PREVENTION**

**It is a CRITICAL ERROR to:**
- ❌ Write code that calls backend APIs/SDKs without explicitly querying docs/MCP first
- ❌ Guess method names or parameters
- ❌ Ignore TypeScript errors on SDK methods (errors indicate incorrect method usage)
- ❌ Copy examples from this skill without verification (examples may be outdated)
- ❌ Assume SDK methods match REST API endpoints

**For Medusa specifically:**
- **Medusa pricing**: Display prices as-is - DO NOT divide by 100 (unlike Stripe, Medusa stores prices in display format)
- **Medusa MCP server**: https://docs.medusajs.com/mcp - Recommend setup if not installed
- Load `reference/medusa.md` for Medusa-specific patterns (regions, pricing, etc.)

### Routing Patterns
- **ALWAYS use dynamic routes** for products and categories - NEVER create static pages for individual items
- Product pages: Use dynamic routes like `/products/[handle]` or `/products/$handle`, NOT `/products/shirt.tsx`
- Category pages: Use dynamic routes like `/categories/[handle]` or `/categories/$handle`, NOT `/categories/women.tsx`
- Framework-specific patterns:
  - **Next.js App Router**: `app/products/[handle]/page.tsx` or `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`
  - **Next.js Pages Router**: `pages/products/[handle].tsx`
  - **SvelteKit**: `routes/products/[handle]/+page.svelte`
  - **TanStack Start**: `routes/products/$handle.tsx`
  - **Remix**: `routes/products.$handle.tsx`
- Why: Dynamic routes scale to any number of products/categories without creating individual files
- Static routes are unmaintainable and don't scale (imagine creating 1000 product files)

## Pattern Selection Guides

When you need to choose between implementation patterns, load the relevant reference file:

- **Checkout strategy** (single-page vs multi-step) → Load `reference/layouts/checkout.md`
- **Navigation strategy** (dropdown vs megamenu) → Load `reference/components/navbar.md` and `reference/components/megamenu.md`
- **Product listing strategy** (pagination vs infinite scroll vs load more) → Load `reference/layouts/product-listing.md`
- **Search strategy** (autocomplete vs filters vs natural language) → Load `reference/components/search.md`
- **Mobile vs desktop priorities** → Load `reference/mobile-responsiveness.md`
- **Variant selection** (text vs swatches vs configurator) → Load `reference/layouts/product-details.md`
- **Cart pattern** (popup vs drawer vs page navigation) → Load `reference/components/cart-popup.md` and `reference/layouts/cart.md`
- **Trust signals strategy** → Load `reference/layouts/product-details.md` and `reference/layouts/checkout.md`

Each reference file contains decision frameworks with specific criteria to help you choose the right pattern for your context.

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Starting a New Storefront

**IMPORTANT: For each step below, load the referenced files BEFORE implementing that step.**

```
1. Discovery Phase → Read design.md for user preferences
2. Foundation Setup → Read connecting-to-backend.md (or medusa.md for Medusa), mobile-responsiveness.md, seo.md
3. Core Components → Implement navbar.md, footer.md
4. Home Page → Read home-page.md
5. Product Browsing → Read product-listing.md, product-card.md, search.md
6. Product Details → Read product-details.md, product-reviews.md
7. Cart & Checkout → Read cart-popup.md, cart.md, checkout.md, order-confirmation.md
8. User Account → Read account.md
9. Additional Features → Read wishlist.md, promotions.md
10. Optimization → SEO audit (seo.md), mobile testing (mobile-responsiveness.md)
```

Even if you create an implementation plan, refer back to the skill and load relevant reference files when implementing each step.

### Shopping Flow Pattern

```
Browse → View → Cart → Checkout

Browse:   home-page.md → product-listing.md
View:     product-details.md + product-reviews.md
Cart:     cart-popup.md → cart.md
Checkout: checkout.md → order-confirmation.md
```

### Component Selection Guide

**For product grids and filtering** → `product-listing.md` and `product-card.md`
**For product cards** → `product-card.md`
**For navigation** → `navbar.md` and `megamenu.md`
**For search functionality** → `search.md`
**For checkout flow** → `checkout.md`
**For promotions and sales** → `promotions.md`

## Design Considerations

Before implementing, consider:

1. **User preferences** - Read `design.md` to discover design style preferences
2. **Brand identity** - Colors, typography, tone that match the brand
3. **Target audience** - B2C vs B2B, demographics, device usage
4. **Product type** - Fashion vs electronics vs groceries affect layout choices
5. **Business requirements** - Multi-currency, multi-language, region-specific
6. **Backend system** - API structure affects component implementation

## Integration with Medusa

[Medusa](https://medusajs.com) is a modern, flexible ecommerce backend. Consider Medusa when:

- Building a new ecommerce storefront
- Need a headless commerce solution
- Want built-in support for multi-region, multi-currency
- Need powerful promotion and discount engine
- Require flexible product modeling

For detailed Medusa integration guidance, see `reference/medusa.md`. For general backend patterns, see `reference/connecting-to-backend.md`.

### Framework Agnostic

All guidance is framework-agnostic. Examples use React/TypeScript where code demonstrations are helpful, but patterns apply to:

- Next.js
- SvelteKit
- Tanstack Start
- Any modern frontend framework

## Minimum Viable Features

**Mandatory for launch (core shopping flow):**
- Navbar with cart, categories, search
- Product listing with filtering and pagination

## Top Ecommerce Mistakes to Avoid

Before implementing, watch out for these common ecommerce-specific pitfalls:

**1. Cart and Navigation Mistakes**
- ❌ Hiding cart indicator in mobile hamburger menu (keep always visible)
- ❌ Not showing real-time cart count updates
- ❌ **CRITICAL: Missing `aria-live="polite"` on cart count** - Screen readers won't announce cart updates without it
- ❌ Not displaying variant details (size, color, etc.) in cart popup - only showing product title
- ❌ Megamenu closes when hovering over dropdown content (must stay open when hovering trigger OR dropdown)
- ❌ **CRITICAL: Megamenu positioning errors** - Three common mistakes:
  - ❌ Navbar doesn't have `position: relative` (megamenu won't position correctly)
  - ❌ Megamenu positioned relative to trigger button instead of navbar (use `absolute left-0` on megamenu)
  - ❌ Megamenu doesn't span full width (must use `right-0` or `w-full`, not just `w-auto`)
- ❌ Hardcoding categories, featured products, or any dynamic content instead of fetching from backend
- ❌ No clear indication of current page in category navigation

**2. Product Browsing Mistakes**
- ❌ Creating static routes for products/categories (use dynamic routes like `/products/[handle]` instead of `/products/shirt.tsx`)
- ❌ Missing "no products found" empty state with helpful suggestions
- ❌ No loading indicators while fetching products
- ❌ Pagination without SEO-friendly URLs (for search engines)
- ❌ Filter selections that don't persist on page reload

**3. Product Details Mistakes**
- ❌ Enabling "Add to Cart" before variant selection (size, color, etc.)
- ❌ Missing product images optimization (large uncompressed images)
- ❌ Navigating away from product page after adding to cart (stay on page)
- ❌ Using emojis in UI instead of icons or images (unprofessional, accessibility issues)

**4. Design and Consistency Mistakes**
- ❌ **CRITICAL: Not loading `reference/design.md` before creating ANY UI component** - Leads to inconsistent colors, fonts, and styles
- ❌ Introducing new colors without checking existing theme first
- ❌ Adding new fonts without verifying what's already used
- ❌ Using arbitrary Tailwind values when theme tokens exist
- ❌ Not detecting Tailwind version (v3 vs v4) - Causes syntax errors

**5. Checkout and Conversion Mistakes**
- ❌ Requiring account creation to checkout (offer guest checkout if backend supports it)
- ❌ Not fetching payment methods from backend - assuming available payment options or skipping payment method selection
- ❌ Overly complex multi-step checkout (4+ steps kills conversion) - Optimal is 3 steps: Shipping Info, Delivery Method + Payment, Review
- ❌ Missing trust signals (secure checkout badge, return policy link)
- ❌ Not handling out-of-stock errors gracefully during checkout

**6. Mobile Experience Mistakes**
- ❌ Touch targets smaller than 44x44px (buttons, links, form fields)
- ❌ Desktop-style hover menus on mobile (use tap/click instead)
- ❌ Not optimizing images for mobile (loading huge desktop images)
- ❌ Missing mobile-specific patterns (bottom nav, drawer filters)

**7. Performance and SEO Mistakes**
- ❌ Missing structured data (Product schema) for SEO
- ❌ No explicit image lazy loading (don't assume browser defaults) - Always add `loading="lazy"` to images below the fold
- ❌ Missing meta tags and Open Graph for social sharing
- ❌ Not optimizing Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) - Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) or Lighthouse to measure

**8. Backend Integration Mistakes**
- ❌ **ERROR: Writing code that calls backend APIs/SDKs without following the 5-step verification workflow** - You MUST: 1) PAUSE, 2) QUERY docs/MCP, 3) VERIFY with user, 4) Write code, 5) CHECK for type errors
- ❌ **ERROR: Ignoring TypeScript errors on SDK methods** - Type errors mean you used wrong method names or parameters. Go back and verify with docs/MCP
- ❌ **ERROR: Guessing API method names, SDK methods, or parameters** - Always verify exact method signatures before use
- ❌ **ERROR: Not using Medusa MCP server when available** - If using Medusa backend, always query MCP server for methods
- ❌ **ERROR: Copying code examples without verifying they're current** - Examples may be outdated, always verify first
- ❌ Not detecting which backend is being used (check monorepo, ask user if unsure)
- ❌ Assuming API structure without checking backend documentation or MCP server
- ❌ Hardcoding dynamic content (categories, regions, products, etc.) instead of fetching from backend
- ❌ Defining custom types for Medusa entities instead of using `@medusajs/types` package
- ❌ Initializing Medusa SDK without publishable API key (required for multi-region stores and product pricing)
- ❌ Fetching Medusa products without passing `region_id` query parameter (causes missing or incorrect pricing)
- ❌ Showing all countries in Medusa checkout - should only show countries from cart's region
- ❌ Dividing Medusa prices by 100 (Medusa stores prices as-is, not in cents like Stripe)
- ❌ Missing Vite SSR config for Medusa SDK (add `ssr.noExternal: ['@medusajs/js-sdk']` to vite.config.ts)
- ❌ Running Medusa storefront on port other than 8000 (causes CORS errors - Medusa backend expects port 8000 by default)
- ❌ Not handling loading, error, and empty states for API calls
- ❌ Making API calls on client-side that should be server-side (SEO, security)
- ❌ Not implementing proper error messages ("Error occurred" vs "Product out of stock")
- ❌ Missing cache invalidation (stale product data, prices, inventory)
- ❌ **Not clearing cart state after order is placed** - Cart popup shows old items because cart wasn't reset from Context/localStorage/cache
